                You can find the feedback and figma files in the sources section below.
                <br><br> 
                For my portfolio, I asked for some feedback about the site. I also conducted a user test with a few
                people. I did this
                with an interactive prototype in Figma. A user test was conducted with Dirk Norg, which is in my
                Feedpulse.
                I also used my site as a prototype. I received feedback regarding the navbar and how it navigates to
                parts of the page. The navbar was not very neat and was a bit too much, so I adjusted the opacity
                and added a border.<br><br>
                Furthermore, the site did not scroll well to the parts of the page; I fixed this with padding
                so that the navbar does not overlap with the title.
                After applying all the feedback, everything was legible and clear. The navbar now also better fits
                the site and is less distracting.

            <p class="text-right">
                Here I experimented a lot with logos and showed them to the stakeholder and students together with Loes.
                We used a CMD method, a survey.
                With that survey, they could choose between the logos and give feedback. Based on that feedback, two
                logos were
                favored. With this feedback and logos, I could create a new logo.
                My logo did not become the final logo. However, I did make the poster for which we received feedback
                from the stakeholder. I applied this feedback and made a new one, which became the final
                poster. <br><br>
                Thanks to the CMD method prototyping, we discovered that the logo was not easily readable on a shirt or
                sweater. If you put the logo on a shirt or sweater, for example,
                the text would be hard to read and the soundwave would become pixelated. We also asked the stakeholder
                for feedback, and they agreed with us.
                The solution was to only use the text on a shirt or sweater, so the name would still be there without
                the soundwave interfering.
                <br><br>
                I also created a persona for the soundlab project. I did this with the CMD method persona. This way I
                could see what the target group wanted for the branding and what they would like. With a persona in
                place, I can tailor the messaging and communication strategies to resonate with the target audience.
                Understanding their preferences and communication style allows me to craft content that are more
                engaging and relevant to the target audience.

            </h3>
            <p class="text-right">
                Here I looked at which media platform the part-time students used the most; I did this with the
                interview Job conducted.
                By using the interview CMD method, you learn where best to advertise
                for the program. I also looked at what information the students were missing but wanted to know before
                starting the program. <br><br>
                With this, I could create a LinkedIn post that would attract them.
                This had to be in the Fontys house style, which I found on the <a class="link-text" href="#source">site</a>.
                As a design platform, I used Adobe Illustrator. We showed all the designs of the posts to the
                stakeholder,
                who gave us feedback that it looked neat and wants to try the method as well.

            <p class="text-right">
                For project-X i'm making a stardew valley mod, I needed to understand color theory and design principles
                to ensure the mod seamlessly integrates into the game's environment. I also researched the modding tools
                for the game. This would be SMAPI.
                I also need to understand the game's mechanics and how the mod would interact with them. And of course
                test the mod on players to get feedback. For pixel art i need to focus on color palettes and shading.

                CMD METHODS
            </h3>
            <p class="text-right">
                For CMD methods, I used survey, prototyping and persona.<br><br>
                For the survey, Loes and I created a survey for the branding. In it, the students and stakeholders could
                choose between the logos and give feedback. Based on that feedback, we created a new logo.
                I chose the survey because I wanted to get a lot of feedback and answers in a short time.<br>
                For prototyping, I used my portfolio as a prototype. I could ask for feedback about the site and the
                navbar. I did this with an interactive prototype in Figma.
