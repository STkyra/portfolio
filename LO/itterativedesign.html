            <p class="text-right">
                For my portfolio, I made many iterations and asked for feedback. Initially, I started with a lot of
                colors and moved to more natural tones. This is because I find it more pleasing to the eye and it looks
                calmer. I also asked for a lot of feedback from fellow students and teachers. I asked for feedback on
                colors, layout, and text. I received a lot of help with this. Stan helped me with the font.
                Additionally, I asked Dirk for feedback on colors and layout; he was my semester 1 coach.
                <br><br>
                At first, I had a lot of rounded corners and non-rounded corners. I asked for feedback and the response
                was that it could be "messy" but it should be consistent. So, I made all the corners non-rounded and
                adjusted the layout. I also asked for feedback on the sticky navbar. Initially, it wasn't quite right,
                but thanks to the feedback, I adjusted the color and changed the opacity.

            <!-- Section: PROJECT BRANDING -->
            <h3 class="text-left">PROJECT <br> BRANDING</h3>
            <p class="text-right">
                For this, I created a logo and chose a font. I did this in Figma and Adobe Illustrator. I made many
                logos to see what best suited the assignment. Eventually, I chose a logo and created a color palette for
                it. I asked for feedback on this from fellow students and teachers. I also made a poster for the
                branding. I did this in Adobe Illustrator.
                <br><br>
                I then hung the poster among the posters of other students in the class. I received feedback from the
                stakeholder and the teachers on this. I adjusted the poster based on this feedback and asked for
                feedback again. I also created a style guide for the project in Figma.
            </p>
            <!-- Section: PROJECT MEDIA CAMPAIGN -->
            <h3 class="text-left">PROJECT <br> MEDIA CAMPAIGN</h3>
            <p class="text-right">
                For the media campaign, I created a LinkedIn post. I did this in Adobe Illustrator. First, I made a test
                post in Figma and asked for feedback on it. Then, I made the post in Adobe Illustrator. In the
                presentation, I explained why the LinkedIn post is useful and how to use it. This is also useful for the
                stakeholder to see how the branding looks on a post and how to attract new students with it. After the
                presentation, we received feedback from the stakeholder and the teachers, which we applied to the
                development project.
                <br><br>
                We also created a Word document for the stakeholder. It includes an explanation of the branding and the
                media campaign. This is useful information, and it also contains a brief summary of the interview Job
                conducted with the students and the questions we had for the target audience.
            </p>
            <!-- Section: PROJECT DEVELOPMENT -->
            <h3 class="text-left">PROJECT <br> DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <p class="text-right">
                For the development project, we created a design for a website. We did this in Figma. Job had already
                created a design, and we asked for feedback on it. The feedback was that the site wasn't neat and
                generally didn't fit. We then changed the design and asked for feedback again.
                <br><br>
                The feedback we received was that it looked good and that we could start building it. We built the
                website in HTML and CSS. We tested the website and asked for feedback from the stakeholder and the
                teachers. The feedback was positive, and we could present it. We presented the website and received
                feedback from the stakeholder and the teachers.

            <p class="text-right">
                I utilized Adobe Illustrator for iterative design. Initially, I crafted a sketch for the couch,
                focusing on details to align with the game's aesthetic. after I received feedback from the stakeholder I
                started to create the couch in Illustrator. I made a few iterations and asked for feedback on them. The
                feedback was positive, and I could start buidling the mod.

            <h3 id="cmd" class="text-left">CMD METHODS</h3>
            <p class="text-right">
                For CMD methods, I used moodboard and sketching.
                <br><br>
                For moodboard, I created a moodboard in Figma. I looked at what I liked and what I wanted to use for my
                portfolio/branding.
                <br>
                For sketching, I drew sofas in Illustrator. I did this to see how I could best draw a sofa and what I
                liked.
