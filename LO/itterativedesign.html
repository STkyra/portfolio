                In my experience with iterative design, I've made numerous tweaks and adjustments to both my projects and portfolio. 
                Whenever I sought feedback, I made sure to take it seriously and apply it to the next version. 
                This process allowed me to constantly improve and refine my work. Now, when I look back, 
                I can see how my projects benefited from the feedback I received.

                As you can see in the picture to the left I've also made itterations for the branding project. This way I could see which logo
                I thought fit the best and build from there. After the survey I also made some new logo itterations which fit with wat the people wanted,
                or thought would fit best.
