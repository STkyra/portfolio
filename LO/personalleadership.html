                For my portfolio, I asked teachers for feedback, using Feedpulse or directly putting it into Figma if I
                missed using Feedpulse. This helped me iterate quickly and keep all the feedback handy. Working on my
                portfolio was fun, and I picked up some new skills along the way. Now, I'm good with Git for version
                control and I've got grid and flexbox down for layouts.
                <br><br>
                I also figured out that using GitLab is better than GitHub. GitLab's backed up by the school, so even if
                I delete stuff, my old portfolios and projects stay safe. Thanks to Maikel, I know how to smoothly move
                my GitHub stuff over to GitLab.

            <p class="text-right">
                With branding I learned how to make a content strategy. I also learned what a brand guide is and how to
                make itterations. <br><br>
                Regarding the content strategy, I gained really useful insights into creating strategies that match
                goals and connect with the audience. By putting emphasis on what users want, I learned how to create
                organized plans that boost engagement and create meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, we didn't have
                much time left for the content strategy, which I regret. I wish we had more time to work on it so I
                could have crafted a stronger strategy.<br>
                For the brand guide Even though I didn't make a brand guide myself, I picked up a lot from studying them
                and seeing what my classmates did. Learning how brand identity affects design and content choices has
                been really valuable for me <br>
                For the itterations I've learned to keep improving projects by getting feedback, looking at results, and
                making things better step by step. This way, I make sure what I deliver is good and stays relevant.
                It also helps me stay flexible and quick to adapt in any situation.

            <p class="text-right">
                The media campaign project has been a big help in my personal and professional growth. It allowed me
                to dive deep into creating awareness and developing effective branding strategies. I learned how to
                craft engaging messages, reach target audience, and use various social media to advertise.
                <br><br>
                Exploring branding strategy was a valuable experience. I discovered the importance of maintaining a
                consistent brand identity and strategically positioning it in competitive markets. Working with a
                team also helped me see things from different
                perspectives, which greatly stimulated creativity and innovation.
                <br><br>
                Looking back, this experience has given me valuable skills and confidence in communication.
                I'm looking forward to apply these insights to future projects and continue exploring new opportunities
                in this
                field.

            <p class="text-right">
                For the development project, I learned how to create a website from scratch while stuck to a 
                corporate identity. I used HTML and CSS to
                build the site, and I learned how to use JavaScript to make it interactive. I also learned how to
                use Git for version control, which helped me keep track of changes and collaborate with my team.
                <br><br>
                Working on this project was a great learning experience. I learned how to communicate
                effectively, and manage my time efficiently. I also learned how to use feedback to improve my work
                and make better design decisions. Overall, this project helped me develop my technical skills and
                gain valuable experience in web development.

                While working with adobe illustrator for the recolor of the couch,
                I've honed my skills in pixel art, playing with colors and details to match the game's style.
                <br>
                Getting feedback from my stakeholder was key. His input on colors and design pushed me to
                improve. By listening to his ideas, I made the mod more visually appealing.
                <br>
                This experience boosted not just my design skills but also my communication. It showed me
                how important it is to collaborate with stakeholders and make something that really connects with people.
