                For the project, we created a Word document and listed all tasks. This way, we could see what needed to
                be done. We also created a house style for the project. At the beginning of the project, we also made a
                collaboration contract. It includes the rules everyone must follow and what happens if someone does not
                adhere to them. <br><br>
                I also used the trend analysis from the DOT-framework. In it, I looked for trends relevant to the
                project. We made a presentation for the stakeholder and instructor. Everyone had a slide to present.

            <p class="text-right">
                For this project, we had the same group as in the branding project. Therefore, we kept the contract.
                This time, we also created a Trello board. We listed all tasks and who was responsible for each one.
                This allowed us to see who had completed what and what still needed to be done. <br><br>
                We also created a Word document for the media campaign. It outlined what we planned to do, how we would
                do it, all questions we had, and the answers to them. We also made a presentation for the stakeholder
                and instructor. We explained why we made certain choices and how we executed them. We received feedback
                and incorporated it into the next project.

            <p class="text-right">
                For this project, I created a Trello board, and Loes made a Word document. We divided tasks. I created
                the entire site in HTML and CSS. We also made several feedback pulses, which contain all the feedback we
                received. Additionally, we created a retrospective together. This is in the development OVP PDF, which
                outlines what went well and what could be improved based on previous projects. <br><br>
                For this project, there was a sort of market presentation, where we presented our project to the
                stakeholder and instructor. We received feedback, which I noted in the feedback pulse.

            <p class="text-right">
                In my project to recolor a couch in Stardew Valley, I applied professional
                standards by organizing tasks effectively and communicating with stakeholders for feedback on colors and
                design. I conducted research to enhance pixel art techniques that fit the game's style and documented
                progress and decisions to keep everything transparent and improve the mod over time. This experience has
                not only sharpened my design skills but also taught me the importance of structured project management
                and collaborative communication.

                CMD METHODS
            </h3>
            <p class="text-right">
                I used several CMD methods, such as surveys, prototyping, and field research.
                <br><br>
                Survey: I used surveys to get direct feedback from users. This helped me better understand their needs
                and preferences, and to better tailor projects to what they really wanted. <br>
                Prototyping: Prototyping was necessary as it allowed me to quickly test ideas in models. By doing this,
                I could quickly see what worked and what didn't before developing further. <br>
                Field Trials: After testing my prototypes, I tested my solutions in real situations. This gave me
                valuable feedback from real users (fellow students and my parents) and helped me adjust my products
                before continuing development. <br><br>
                This approach allowed me to strengthen my projects with insights and solutions focused on the user. It
                helped not only in delivering more effective products but also in improving my skills in project
                management and user experience. <br><br>
                In the future, I want to use better tools for more detailed survey results and more enjoyable
                prototyping. I also want to improve my skills in analyzing field test data to gain better insights. By
                applying these methods, I have strengthened my projects with a structured approach focused on
                user-oriented solutions.
